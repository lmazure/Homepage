<P>
<CENTER>1915 bombs were flying</CENTER>
<CENTER>Occident was already burning.</CENTER>
<CENTER>No one was taking care about the shootings,</CENTER>
<CENTER>in the Caucasus plains I see the crowd yelling.</CENTER>
<CENTER>From all this now I only see crime,</CENTER>
<CENTER>crime, blood, rapes, tears, distress and misery.</CENTER>
<CENTER>For a while yet just one order for every soldier:</CENTER>
<CENTER>Gun the Amenian people down...</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>Ararat mountain eyes are the witness of our pains til' the end of time.</CENTER>
</P><P>
<B><CENTER>Genocide, genocide</CENTER>
<CENTER>millions of corpses for a piece of land.</CENTER></B>
</P><P>
<CENTER>For 2 years blood ran</CENTER>
<CENTER>through your hands,</CENTER>
<CENTER>disgust, cowardice scorn, hatred suit you so fine.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Victims voices of my past sound again and again on the earth.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I keep in mind of every people who lost millions of victims in the darkness</CENTER>
<CENTER>and to you lost in your sorrowful world I tell:</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>The death there's no death,</CENTER>
<CENTER>just a lovely trip my friends to another land</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>Hay mer...</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>I'm the devil haunting your country's nightmares,</CENTER>
<CENTER>people give me the world no one is innocent, that's why they will all pay.</CENTER>
<CENTER>My anger is a poisoned gift,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I spit on your past, spit on the war.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I keep in mind of every people who lost millions of victims in the darkness</CENTER>
<CENTER>and to you lost in your sorrowful world I tell:</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>The death there's no death.</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>Just a lovely trip my friends to another land.</CENTER>
<CENTER>To another land, to another land my friends...</CENTER>
