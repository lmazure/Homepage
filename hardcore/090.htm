<center><h1>Don't walk away</h1></center>

<center>Broken glass from the window shattered yesterday
<br>Deep inside me I feel the same
<br>All the while reflections on the one that went away
<br>Shine off these pale four walls
<br>Dissonance is the only song I want to sing
<br>I would pray if I knew that you were listening
<p>Don't walk away, Don't walk away
<br>I surrender, to you today
<br>This bended knee is breaking me
<br>I'll surrender, I'll surrender
<p>Staring down the pages of saltwater memories
<br>Emotions etched from the heart
<br>That was bled so dry
<br>There's nothing left to find
<br>But the ashes of my soul
<p>I surrender
<br>It will be better
<br>This is my vow to change
<p>It stands to reason that some things
<br>Were never meant to be
<br>I should have known from the start
<br>The race has been run
<br>And all is said and done
<br>Ashes have been swept away
<p>Don't walk away, Don't walk away
<br>I surrender, to you today
<br>This bended knee is breaking me
<br>I'll surrender, I surrender</center>
