<center><h1>No one nothing</h1></center>

<center>I sit alone and watch the lonely people
<br>It's like I'm staring at myself
<br>Because we're all the same
<br>We all want the same thing
<p>Everybody wants the other
<br>Broken is just one
<br>Put the pieces back together
<br>Let love's will be done
<p>Related by a constant craving that won't fade
<br>Relief it seems so far away
<br>When you have no one
<br>Then you've got nothing
<p>Won't you put me back together...</center>
