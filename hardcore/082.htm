<center><h1>Suckerpunch</h1></center>

<center>It's been about a dozen seasons
<br>Since the boy became a man
<br>Now he sees the forest for the trees
<br>Now he touches just enough to feel
<br>He's much stronger than he was just yesterday
<p>Won't get suckerpunched again
<br>Gotta sink so you can swim
<br>Ya know?
<br>You never really learn
<br>Till you fail and feel the burn
<br>Ya know?
<p>He looks back and has to pity where he's been
<br>Then he smiles and walks away
<br>There were days when it hurt too much to handle
<br>Foolish boy had to learn how to dismantle
<br>All those memories that wouldn't seem to leave
<p>There is a reason
<br>Some reason for all of this
<br>Affliction is a contradiction to our happiness
<br>Except for those who know
<br>Those who know</center>
