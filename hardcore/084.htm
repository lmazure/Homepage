<center><h1>Always</h1></center>

<center>Are you growing weary as you dance all alone
<br>In a room that's resonating with an old familiar song
<br>Making you want the other
<br>For awhile there wasn't friction and alone you were at ease
<br>But now and then there's something that makes you want to be back in
the arms - but you can't take it
<p>It always, always, seems to find you
<br>What you want you don't need
<br>'Cause she locks you down
<br>So aren't you better off as one?
<p>This prince with little purpose thinks he'll find it in the wings
<br>Of an angel or a princess but surely not a queen
<br>But that's about the only thing that he knows for sure
<br>Yeah, he's the king of contradiction who changes every day
<br>One minute he finds peace and love and the next he finds disdain
<br>It's way too complicated things will never change
<p>Always, seems like you always
<br>Claim to have so much control
<br>But you're such a mess when you're all alone
<p>Do you really want to do it have you washed out all the stains
<br>You seem crazy with temptation and very very dazed and confused
<br>Who's buying your throne
<br>That stone inside you call a heart thaws just enough to beat
<br>And familiar feelings come as you surrender to the needs of another
<br>Not another
<p>Always, seems like you always
<br>Claim to have so much control
<br>But you're such a mess when you're all alone
<br>Always, seems like you always
<br>Seems like you look for any kind of reason
<br>To justify a means to jump back in</center>
