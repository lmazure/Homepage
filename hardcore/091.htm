<center><h1>Overflow</h1></center>

<center>The dial tone is all that sings
<br>It's raining hard inside and far away
<br>What's so new
<br>This never-ending drama won't fade
<br>My guts a coil and my only drain
<p>Will this ever end
<br>It's breaking heart, it's bruising head
<br>Why does the good go so bad
<br>All the joy is fading fast
<p>The contradictions they are killing me
<br>This pretzel logic makes her hard to receive
<br>So fall out again
<br>And swallow me whole
<br>Everything's changed
<br>From blowing kisses to throwing stones
<p>Night trade with day
<br>And let dawn begin to break
<br>And once again she knows me too well
<br>How to heal how to help
<p>For awhile I am saved by her smile
<br>And all the harm comes undone
<br>Just soon enough to stop the flood
<br>The overflow
<br>Should her charm not hold
<br>It could drown me today
<br>Must the river run so high my love
<p>You know your smile can dam the river that I have of... you</center>
