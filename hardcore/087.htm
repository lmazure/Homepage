<center><h1>Fallout</h1></center>

<center>I've done it to myself once again
<br>Breaking off a piece for everyone
<br>I gave in good faith
<br>In you I believed
<br>But these efforts to connect
<br>Just segregate given time
<br>Then walls grow taller
<br>Not with bricks and mortar
<br>But with distance and indifference
<br>And you trust like children
<br>And you break like glass
<br>Will you please put me back together?
<p>Just for a minute
<br>You were my best friend
<br>What I gave you took away
<p>Give it back
<p>Swimming in a sea of nameless faces
<br>Good-natured boy wants the world to be his friend
<br>Is that the rock tied around his ankle
<br>That will drag him down
<br>And drown him in the end
<p>He needs a hand to hold
<br>He needs a hand
<br>Do you have one to lend?
<br>Past to present is all he seems to know
<br>Understand that's the reason
<br>He's afraid to give again
<p>Just for a minute
<br>You were my best friend
<br>What I gave you took away
<p>It just bleeds into one anymore
<br>So sad but common to throw this blanket over all
<br>Is that the state of relations that I made for myself
<br>'Cause it's cake to doubt and I won't trust again
<br>And the fallout takes its toll
<br>The fallout takes its toll on me and on you
<br>When it settles will we ever be the same
<br>Time heals a broken heart but the scars they never go away</center>
