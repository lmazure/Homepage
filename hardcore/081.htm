<center><h1>Shuddershell</h1></center>

<center>To me you are the warmest season
<br>You have always been the brightest sun
<br>But these clich&eacute;s will not be spoken
<br>I'd choke on my lead tongue
<p>So self-aware it's a burden
<br>Forever crippled by that tendency
<br>Please evict me from my shuddershell
<br>So I can speak
<p>This is so frustrating
<br>I don't know what I'm saying
<br>This loss for words seems to burrow deeper every day
<br>I'm so misunderstood
<br>Cannot relay the good
<br>That's stranded deep inside
<br>'Cause next to you... I'm at a loss for words
<p>Don't confuse this for confession
<br>Or as a plea for sympathy
<br>It's just a window to a soul bound
<br>By all my insecurity</center>
