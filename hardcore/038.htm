<P>
<CENTER>Those damn mother fuckers don't give a damn about the way I live, about the things I claim.</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>They ignore the real weight of my life thinking their lives are much louder than mine.</CENTER>
<CENTER>They judge my friends my clothes and my name they got the power, but I still got pain,</CENTER>
<CENTER>but I don't give a damn, just keep a front for their eyes. Gonna make those mother fuckers realize.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'm blind, I'm deaf but most of all I'm dumb. To you I'm a number and I've got to run.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Why should I pay for your crimes with my tears? Why is there a smile on the 20 dollars bill?</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>Rusty faces for you my friend I tell ya.</CENTER>
<CENTER>In god we trust you tell me but let me tell you I don't.</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>Those mother fuckers don't give a damn about the may I live, about the things I claim.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Rusted blood in your rusted veins, rusty laws are the rusted chains.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Your religion I don't want anymore let me move let me choose, I'm sick to the core.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Ignorant that's the name I give ya, locked up minds and rusted souls.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Out of date or simple-minded so stupid to believe it.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I shout my lyrics straight to you like a bomb. I give any credit and on the floor let you drop.</CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER>Those damn mother fuckers...</CENTER>
<CENTER>and make those MFS realize...</CENTER>
