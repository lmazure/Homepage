<center><h1>Forfeit</h1></center>

<center>Once again I must fold
<br>Give in get out before I'm broke
<br>What was at stake
<br>Means too much, too much to me
<br>Tremble as I get up from the table
<br>'Cause I gambled foolishly
<p>I can take the drama no more
<br>So I throw down my hand and say
<br>It's over please forgive me
<br>It's over I forfeit
<br>So I won't bleed
<p>The game played well for awhile
<br>Just to hold
<br>Just to feel
<br>Just to smile
<br>It felt so good to breathe again my angel
<br>But reservation won't release
<p>The risk I could not afford to take
<br>Eclipsed all the love that you made
<br>And so I'll go</center>
