<center><h1>12/31</h1></center>

<center>If I had a drink... I'd drink it
<br>If I had a drug... I'd take it
<br>I'd do anything to peel away the pain I feel right now
<br>It's mild December 31
<br>Snow cries hard onto flooded earth
<br>But it can't compare to tear-soaked beds
<br>Shared by forbidden lovers again
<p>One more time: Before we fade away
<br>And turn the page
<br>One last time: With a final kiss
<br>Remember this 12/31
<p>I'm the one who sits alone
<br>It's my fault I can't hold my own
<br>You see I'm broken down and bleeding from a six months scab we peeled
away tonight
<p>In the year's last hour
<br>The swan song will fade at last
<br>And I will sing no more
<br>So just let me go</center>
