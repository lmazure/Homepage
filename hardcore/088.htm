<center>She tries to find the weak spot
<br>She tries to push through
<br>To her I'm not a criminal she appeals
<br>And wants the sentence reduced
<br>Now I need to restrain, don't want to give in
<br>Let me pay for the crimes I've committed
<p>Everything is caving in
<br>From the weight of her world
<br>My self-effacing fortress is too weak
<br>To withstand the self-assured
<br>Just get out while you can
<br>He'll take you away
<br>Once it's gone you'll understand
<br>(Will you please)
<p>Save her from myself
<br>Don't want to hurt anybody else
<br>So I build my castle high
<br>Warning you to stay away
<p>The war think it's over
<br>But nobody really won
<br>As I stumble through the rubble
<br>Then I see what kept her from getting in
<br>A wary heart
<br>And the thickest of skin</center>
