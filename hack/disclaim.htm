<center><h1>Motivation - Disclaimer</h1></center>
I have created these pages for two main reasons:
<ul>
<li>
I use too many computers and Internet is one of my main information sources
for my work, I always had to copy my bookmarks from one computer to another
one. So I decided to put everything on the Web in order to easily get access
to this data. If some other people have the same interests than me, they
may find these pages useful, but the link lists are by no way a real directory:</li>

<ul>
<li>
I presume that several links are broken. If I find such a problem, I correct
it, but I never check proactively that all the links are working.</li>

<li>
The lists are not exhaustive, I just keep the links I use regularly or
some I found useful at one time.</li>
</ul>
If you find a broken link and you know a site that may interest me, just
send me an email, I will look at it. Thanks.
<li>
I believe that Internet is one of the greatest inventions of the century.
I really mean it: the Web is the biggest record of human knowledge existing
today and it should be the task of everyone to help increase this huge
amount of information. This is why I put some data I could not found somewhere
else.</li>
</ul>
Since I am playing sometimes with HTML or JavaScript, some links are not
accessible if you are not surfing with the right browser: I mean Netscape
4.0 or superior ;-) I am sorry for this inconvenience, but Microsoft and
Netscape have diverged in their DHMTL implementations and I am not interesting
in implementing twice the same stuff.
<p>I must confess that some pages are completely useless (my resume, my
ideas...). But without them, this would not really be a <i>personal</i>
homepage...
