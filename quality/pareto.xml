<B><U>Pareto Chart:</U></B><BR/>
The causes are sorted into categories. The frequency of each cause is then evaluated. A Pareto chart is a bar char of the frequencies of each categories, the categories being sorted from left to right from the most frequent to the least one.<BR/>
The aim of a Pareto Chart is to find the vital few causes that must be corrected to avoid most of the defects.

<B><U>Pareto principle:</U></B><BR/>
Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist, studied the distribution wealth in a variety of countries around 1900. He found that about 80% of the wealth in most countries was controlled by about 20% of the people.<BR/>
This the "80:20 rule" or "Pareto's Principle" has been now (ab)used beyond economy: without discussing it the values are 80:20 or 60:40 or 90:10, it means that most of the results/effects come from a minority of effort/causes/persons.
