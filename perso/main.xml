I do not know how you arrived here. Nevertheless, you are welcome.<BR/>
These pages are mainly for my own use. It is not an expert site about some specific subject, nor a proof of my technical knowledge, neither a facade to give a good image of myself… This is just some data useful for me that could be also relevant for others.<BR/>
<BLIST><TITLE>Using the compass icon at the bottom of the page, you can explore this site. The main parts are:</TITLE>
  <ITEM><X><T>Links and articles</T><A>../content/map.html?page=links/life.html</A><L>en</L><F>HTML</F></X><BR/>
    I hate remembering having read something somewhere and being unable to find the day I need the information once again. So I accumulate in these pages miscellaneous (you could say messy) links on information sources and articles.</ITEM>
  <ITEM><X><T>Personal notes</T><A>../content/map.html?page=notes/java2.html</A><L>en</L><F>HTML</F></X><BR/>
    20-25 years ago, I used to have a folders full of papers, themselves full of notes. Since that period, I do not use anymore dead trees, but Web pages. Once again, this is messy, but I already received some feedback from persons who got some use from it.</ITEM>
  <ITEM><X><T>Cooking</T><A>../content/map.html?page=bouffe/095.htm</A><L>fr</L><F>HTML</F></X><BR/>
    Here, most pages are in French, of course! Some recipes I have typed down because of some reason or another. If you try one of these, bon appétit!</ITEM>
  <ITEM>Personal information<BR/>
    My <X><T>resume</T><A>cve.html</A><L>en</L><F>HTML</F></X> and my profiles on some social networking sites.</ITEM>
  <ITEM>Some information about this site<BR/>
    <X><T>Hits</T><A>hits.html</A><L>en</L><F>HTML</F></X>, <X><T>article indexes</T><A>../content/content.html?sort=author</A><L>en</L><F>HTML</F></X>…</ITEM>
