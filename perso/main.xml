I do not know how you arrived here. Nevertheless, you are welcome.<BR/>
These pages are mainly for my own use. It is not an expert site about some specific subject, nor a proof of my technical knowledge, neither a facade to give a good image of myself... This is just some data useful for me that could be also relevant for others.<BR/>

<BLIST><TITLE>Using the navigation tree on the left side, you can explore this site. The main parts are:</TITLE>
<ITEM>Links and articles<BR/>
I hate remembering having read something somewhere and being unable to find the day I need the information once again. So I accumulate in these pages miscellaneous (you could say messy) links on information sources and articles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Personal notes<BR/>
15-20 years ago, I used to have a folders full of papers, themselves full of notes. Since that period, I do not use anymore dead trees, but Web pages. Once again, this is messy, but I already received some feedback from persons who got some use from it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cooking<BR/>
Here, most pages are in French, of course! Some recipes I have typed down because of some reason or another. If you try one of these, bon app&#xE9;tit!</ITEM>
<ITEM>Personal information<BR/>
My resume and my profiles on some social networking sites.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Some information about this site<BR/>
Hits, article indexes...</ITEM>
<ITEM>Archive<BR/>
This site was created in 1995, some stuff is out-of-date or not relevant anymore, you will find it here.</ITEM>
