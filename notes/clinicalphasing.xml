<ITEM><B>Preclinical:</B> Laboratory or animal studies to show biological activity of the compound against the targeted disease, with the compound evaluated for safety and possible formulations.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Phase 0:</B> Micro-doses are given to a small number of subjects (10 to 15) in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Phase 1:</B> A Phase 1 clinical trial is the first step in testing a new investigational medication (or new use of a marketed drug) in humans. Phase 1 studies are mainly concerned with evaluating a drug's safety profile, including the safe dosage range. The studies also determine how the drug is absorbed and broken down by the body, what is the best way to give the drug to a patient (for example by mouth, or by injection), what side effects may be likely, and how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted as well as its duration of action. Except for drugs used to treat cancer, Phase 1 clinical trials are usually conducted in healthy individuals and are not intended to treat disease or illness. Because cancer can be such a life-threatening condition, Phase 1 trials with anti-cancer drugs are usually carried out in patients who already have the disease.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Phase 1b:</B> Phase 1b studies are usually conducted in patients diagnosed with the disease, or condition for which the study drug is intended, who demonstrate some biomarker, surrogate, or possibly clinical outcome that could be considered for "proof of concept." Proof of concept in a Phase 1b study typically confirms the hypothesis that the current prediction of biomarker, or outcome benefit is compatible with the mechanism of action.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Phase 1/2:</B> Phase 1/2 trials combine a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 trial of the same treatment into a single protocol. First the Phase 1 part of the trial is done - to determine the Maximum Tolerable Dose (MTD). Then, more patients are treated at the MTD, in the Phase 2 portion of the study, to further evaluate safety and/or efficacy.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Phase 2:</B> Phase 2 clinical trials involve volunteers who have the disease or condition to be treated. These trials help physicians and researchers begin to learn more about the safety of the new drug treatment and how well the drug treats the targeted disease or condition. Several different doses of the drug may be looked at to see which dose has the desired effects. Patients are monitored for side effects and for any improvement in their illness, symptoms, or both.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Phase 3:</B> After a drug has been shown to have positive results in small groups of patients, it may be studied in a larger Phase 3 trial to confirm efficacy and identify adverse events from long-term use. A Phase 3 trial usually compares how well the study drug works compared with an inactive placebo and/or another approved medication. One group of patients may receive the new drug being tested, while another group of patients may receive the comparator drug (already-approved drug for the disease being studied), or placebo.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Phase 4:</B> Phase 4 clinical trials are sometimes called "post-marketing" trials because these studies begin after the Phase 1 - 3 study results have been given to the FDA for evaluation. These studies may be done to determine if the drug is effective against other disease states, or to test different ways of taking the drug such as tablets, time-release capsules or syrups, or to look for adverse events in larger populations over longer periods of time.</ITEM>

<ITEM><B>Pilot Study:</B> A Proof-of-Concept study designed to explore new hypotheses. They are not intended to be used for registration.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Pivotal Study:</B> Typically a Phase 3 study which presents the data required by a regulatory agency to decide whether or not to approve a drug. A pivotal study will generally be well-controlled, randomized, of adequate size, and whenever possible, double-blind.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Single-Blind Study:</B> A study in which the treatment group assignment is not revealed to the study participant but is known by the investigator.</ITEM>
<ITEM><B>Double-Blind Study:</B> A clinical trial in which neither the investigator nor the study participant is aware of the treatment received.</ITEM>
